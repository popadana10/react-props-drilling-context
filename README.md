Question:

How can we ensure that we refresh the data in all components if we are using prop drilling only?
# react-props-drilling-context

## Credits

This project is based on the initial code provided by our teacher Martin Holland [https://github.com/martin-holland]. The base repository was downloaded as part of React Advanced Course, where more complex concepts were taught.

All additional code and modifications have been made by me during the class coding.
